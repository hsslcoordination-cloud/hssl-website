        <p>
          I am a newly graduated architect from Chalmers University of Technology,
          with a strong interest in thoughtful, context-driven design. My education
          provided a solid foundation in architectural theory, design development,
          and technical execution, with an international outlook at its core.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have two years of professional experience working at Liljewall in
          Gothenburg and at Shigeru Ban Architects in Tokyo. During this time, I
          contributed to projects located in South Africa, Italy, Brazil, and Japan,
          gaining valuable experience in diverse cultural, climatic, and architectural
          contexts.
